I made it an effort this year to adopt more free and open-source software because I like privacy and control over what I use.
Hopefully, this post will help you if you're also looking to do that.

## Using a Password Manager

If the headlines are true, roughly 70% of *Americans* use the same password for more than one account.
Of course this is just a bias sample, but it does put into perspective how little people value security.
To be fair, I didn't care too much either until someone I knew personally was hacked.

Before a password manager, I used an online password generator to generate my passwords and then stored them in an encrypted `.7z` file on an external drive.
This approach is already 99% more secure than most people, but it's really inconvenient to manage because I have to extract it every time I need it.
A smart hacker could also find an unextracted version of the archive because 7-Zip temporarily stores them to disk.

That's when I settled with **KeePassXC** for managing my passwords.
It solves pretty much every issue listed above, on top of supporting more advanced features like automatic password filling and passkeys for passwordless logins.
KeePassXC also supports TOTP for two-factor authentication, which replaces Authy or Microsoft Authenticator.
I'm also backing up my passphrase-protected `.kdbx` database file to an offline computer running Nextcloud and to Dropbox in case I lose access to it.


If you don't like KeyPassXC, Bitwarden and Vaultwarden are pretty decent alternatives.
There's also the original KeePass, but I personally prefer the more integrated feel of KeePassXC.

## Managing Emails with Thunderbird

I use **Thunderbird** to manage my emails because it makes them all easily accessible in one place, I can read my messages offline, and it has much better privacy features.
It's also just much faster and more lightweight than Gmail's UI.
Thunderbird also supports RSS feeds, which I really like, even though it's super old school.
Native system notifications are also pretty nice even though modern browsers already support that.
There's also great user-created extensions out there for Thunderbird such as Send Later and Web Translate.

Ironically, I still rely on Google's servers for my emails.
I may adopt ProtonMail and DuckDuckGo at some point to better maximize privacy, but Google is just too reliable for me.

## Other Cool Stuff

### Mullvad VPN

https://mullvad.net/en

My preferred choice for a VPN because it actually values privacy. No email is required to sign up; a UID is generated for you instead.
Unfortunately, it's not free, and it's a bit pricier than other VPN options.
They also removed port forwarding in 2023 which makes me a little sad. It's still pretty good for torrenting, though.

On another note, Mullvad is very based for standing against Chat Control.

### SmoothCSV

https://smoothcsv.com/

A free and open-source CSV editor that's pretty good if you just need something simple and lightweight.
There's other alternatives out there, but I found them to be too visually destaining.

## Smart Home Future Plans

My home server is mostly for tinkering around, but I want to make it more integrated into my home with **Home Assistant**.
I also want to design a home theater that would be powered by Jellyfin and Radarr.
Sadly, there isn't a good working free and open-source TV client out there.

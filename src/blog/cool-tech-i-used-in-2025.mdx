## Managing Passwords with KeyPassXC

- used the same passwords for 10+ years (somehow didnt get hacked)
- used an encrypted 7zip with a txt file before keypassxc
- it's lightweight
- might set up vaultwarden in the future

## Managing Emails with Thunderbird

- it's ugly but much more lightweight and convenient than gmail's UI
- might adopt proton mail in the future

## Other Useful but Niche Tools

mullvadvpn, smoothcsv, blockbench

## Plans for the Future

- build a dedicated server room that "powers" the whole house
- build a home theater (would be powered by jellyfin)
- set up pihole
- might build a chat app for the funsies

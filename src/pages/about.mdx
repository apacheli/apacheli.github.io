# About Me

Hello, I'm **Jimmy Vang**, a web and software developer. JavaScript and
TypeScript are my flavor of programming languages, but I've also dabbled with
Python, Java, and Lua. My goals are to build fully custom applications with
performance and efficiency in mind. I also like to contribute to open-source
projects.

I'm also a hobbyist graphic designer and artist. I've used Figma and Paint.NET to
design some pretty things such as custom SVG icons for websites and thumbnails
for video platforms such as YouTube.

Check out [my blog](/blog) to see what I've been working on, or
[contact me](/contact) if you're interested in working with me.

## Studies

I study computer science, but the majority of my knowledge and experience stems
from reading documentations and trial and error.

As a software engineer and freelancer, working with clients who want custom
applications for their specific use cases has taught me a lot about the business
and professional side of things for my career path. I've worked with other
brilliant minds to come up with the best solutions possible for any given problem.

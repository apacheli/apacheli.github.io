# About Me

Hello, I'm Jimmy Vang, a web and software developer. JavaScript and TypeScript
are my flavor of programming languages, but I've also dabbled with Python, Java,
and Lua. My goals are to build fully custom applications with performance and
efficiency in mind. I also like to contribute to open-source projects.

I'm also a hobbyist graphic designer and artist. I've use Figma and Paint.NET to
make some cool stuff.

Check out [my blog](/blog) to see what I've been working on, or

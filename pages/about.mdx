# About Me

Hello, I'm Jimmy Vang, a web and software developer. JavaScript and TypeScript
are my flavor of programming languages, but I've also dabbled with Python, Java,
and Lua. My goals are to build fully custom applications with performance and
efficiency in mind. I also like to contribute to open-source projects.

I'm also a hobbyist graphic designer and artist. I've use Figma and Paint.NET to
make some cool stuff, e.g., the icon at the top left.

That's all from me. [Check out my blog](/blog) to see what I've been working on.

## Studies

I study computer science, but the majority of my knowledge and experience stems
from reading documentations and trial and error. If you copy and paste code
enough times, you might learn a thing or two. Don't forget to credit where you
took the code from. Plagiarism is bad!

## Gaming

Open-world, sandbox, and tower defense are my favorite genres of video games. I
also occasionally play FPS games, although I'm dog water at them.

My friend codes:

- Nintendo Switch: `SW-5259-5725-2888`
- Steam: `876434768`

## My PC Build

- CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 5 7600
- GPU: AMD Radeon™ RX 6650 XT

I also have an old computer I use for storing media content. That's pretty epic
if you ask me!

## Other Stuff

I'm from the United States. My time zone is `GMT-5`.

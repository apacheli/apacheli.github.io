# Hello, I'm apacheli. :wave:

I'm a full-stack web developer, graphic designer, and digital artist from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
I build open-source software using Bun and TypeScript with the main purpose being improving developers' experiences.

Check out [my blog](/blog) for my latest projects.

## Studies

I'm currently taking a break with plans to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science sometime in the future.

## How It All Started

Back in 2015, Discord was in its infant years. Our options for bots were fairly limited at the time.
There was a bot called *AutoModerator*, which you could invite via direct messaging. It was pretty much your typical
moderation bot. It served its purpose, but we needed something more custom as our friend group grew.

That's when a friend introduced me to bot development.
We started copying and pasting code off the internet without understanding what we were doing.
*To be fair*, we were still middle schoolers at the time.

## Hobbies

I like to produce music and play video games.

## PC Builds

### 2023-present: First PC Build

It was fun to build it despite some questionable decision-making.
